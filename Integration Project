# The blow code creates two random numbers then adds them to create an
# answer, then a third random value is created to get a second answer. The
# code asks what is the addition of the first two random number. If the user
# input is equal to answer a point is added, then it repeated for known
# answer 2. If the user input is equal to known answer 2 then another point
# is added and it displays score out of total questions would we be
# "# out of 2"

# It is the same for subtraction and multiplication but replaced with the
# proper signs. For division the same process is similar but the answer is
# kept as a decimal and is rounded to the nearest integer to keep answers
# and simple and concise.

# When it comes the the array While loop, A teacher instructor named Vlad
# helped me put the final touches on it to get it working properly. When
# testing for valid inputs within the areas (addition, subtraction,
# etc.) Professor Vanselow guided me to use the "try else" route to ensure
# the loop accounts for both positive and negate values while also making
# sure the input was a number and not a letter or special character.
